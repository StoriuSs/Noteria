# üìù Noteria

Noteria is a modern, full-featured note-taking and productivity app designed to help you organize your thoughts, tasks, and life‚Äîall in one place. With a clean interface, powerful features, and seamless user experience, Noteria is perfect for students, professionals, and anyone who wants to stay organized.

(NOTE!!! Due to only using Render's free plan for now to deploy, you have to wait for about 1 minute to be able to use the app, and the respond is pretty slow.)
